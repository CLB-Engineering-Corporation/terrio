# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- `mosaic`, `warp`, `concat` and `filter merge` now treat an input beginning
  with `@` as a file list, so a file named `@name.tif` must be written
  `./@name.tif`.

### Command line

- `mosaic`, `warp`, `concat` and `filter merge` read inputs from a file list:
  `@FILE` stands for the paths listed in FILE, one per line, as GDAL's
  `--input @filelist.txt` does (#323). MCP tool calls refuse `@FILE`, so that a
  client cannot read a file back through the errors naming its lines.

### Point clouds

- PDAL's `filters.hexbin`: the boundary of points on a grid of hexagons (the hexagons with at
  least a threshold of points, as polygons with holes), with its area, density and point
  spacing, and the hexagons with their counts. `terrio filter hexbin` (and MCP) writes them as
  vector datasets, reading the points in chunks; Python's `PointCloud.hexbin` returns PDAL's
  metadata (`boundary` as WKT, `boundary_json`...) with both as layers; JavaScript's
  `PointCloud.hexbin` returns both as a vector dataset; Rust has `pointcloud::filters::hexbin`
  and `HexBinner`. PDAL's options (`edge_length`/`edge_size` or its estimate from
  `sample_size` points, `threshold`, `smooth`, `hole_cull_area_tolerance`, `precision`) and a
  grid `origin`; H3 grids are not implemented. Hexagons, counts and boundaries (smoothed or not)
  are identical to PDAL 2.10's on autzen; points are assigned to hexagons as hexer assigns them
  (a port, attributed in `NOTICE`).

### CRS compatibility

- Transformer construction now checks celestial-body compatibility for all CRS
  pairs, including custom PROJ definitions without IAU identifiers. Different
  known bodies are rejected. When either body is unidentified, semi-major axes
  must agree within 0.7% of the target radius. For example, `+R=1` to `+R=2`, or a
  lunar/custom small sphere to EPSG:4326, now returns an error; matching custom
  figures remain supported.
- Earth datum operations (`+datum`, `+towgs84`, or datum grids) require an Earth
  figure, including for otherwise matching unidentified custom radii. They are
  rejected on planetary/custom small figures rather than interpreted as valid
  Earth shifts. This intentionally also applies without IAU identifiers. There
  is no `PROJ_IGNORE_CELESTIAL_BODY` override in Rust, CLI/MCP, Python or
  JavaScript. Use a CRS on the correct body; changes of arbitrary coordinate
  units should use the applicable CRS unit parameters.
- Geographic WKT2 definitions with west- or south-positive axes now preserve
  those directions and their declared order, including Earth CRSs. They were
  previously treated as ordinary east/north coordinates. This matches GDAL's
  traditional GIS axis strategy; ordinary north/east Earth axes still use
  longitude, latitude order.
