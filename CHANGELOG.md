# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- `mosaic`, `warp`, `concat` and `filter merge` now treat an input beginning
  with `@` as a file list, so a file named `@name.tif` must be written
  `./@name.tif`.

### Command line

- `mosaic`, `warp`, `concat` and `filter merge` read inputs from a file list:
  `@FILE` stands for the paths listed in FILE, one per line, as GDAL's
  `--input @filelist.txt` does (#323). MCP tool calls refuse `@FILE`, so that a
  client cannot read a file back through the errors naming its lines.

### CRS compatibility

- Transformer construction now checks celestial-body compatibility for all CRS
  pairs, including custom PROJ definitions without IAU identifiers. Different
  known bodies are rejected. When either body is unidentified, semi-major axes
  must agree within 0.7% of the target radius. For example, `+R=1` to `+R=2`, or a
  lunar/custom small sphere to EPSG:4326, now returns an error; matching custom
  figures remain supported.
- Earth datum operations (`+datum`, `+towgs84`, or datum grids) require an Earth
  figure, including for otherwise matching unidentified custom radii. They are
  rejected on planetary/custom small figures rather than interpreted as valid
  Earth shifts. This intentionally also applies without IAU identifiers. There
  is no `PROJ_IGNORE_CELESTIAL_BODY` override in Rust, CLI/MCP, Python or
  JavaScript. Use a CRS on the correct body; changes of arbitrary coordinate
  units should use the applicable CRS unit parameters.
- Geographic WKT2 definitions with west- or south-positive axes now preserve
  those directions and their declared order, including Earth CRSs. They were
  previously treated as ordinary east/north coordinates. This matches GDAL's
  traditional GIS axis strategy; ordinary north/east Earth axes still use
  longitude, latitude order.
- Vertical CRSs without geoid models of their own now use those of the vertical
  CRSs of their datum, as PROJ does. NAVD88 height in US survey feet
  (EPSG:6360) or feet (EPSG:8228) and NAVD88 depth (EPSG:6357, EPSG:6358) go
  through GEOID18 like NAVD88 height (EPSG:5703), in both directions, with the
  unit and direction converted. They previously only converted the unit,
  an error of the geoid undulation (about 27 m in Texas):
  `EPSG:6318+6360` to `EPSG:6319` at 30 N, 97 W turns 328.0833 ftUS
  (100 m) into 73.4074 m, as PROJ 9.9.0, instead of 100 m.
